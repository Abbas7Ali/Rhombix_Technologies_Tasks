            I created this portfolio using web technologies such as React.js,
            Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and JSX. This combination allows for a
            dynamic, responsive design with a focus on user experience. React.js
            enables efficient component-based architecture, while Tailwind CSS
            provides a utility-first approach for styling, ensuring a modern and
            visually appealing layout. Through this portfolio, I showcase my
            skills and passion for web development.
